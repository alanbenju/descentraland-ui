# Descentraland UI

A simple UI for a [Dummy Token](https://github.com/decentraland/dummy-token). This frontend allows the user to connect their wallet and see their address. It is built using `react` + `redux` + `redux-saga`.
- Allow the user to see their Dummy Token balance once their wallet is connected
- Allow the user to transfer Dummy Tokens

## Setup

1. Run `cp .env.example .env` and fill the environment variables
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

You will also need to setup a local ethereum development environment and deploy the Dummy Token there, to do that [follow these instructions](https://github.com/decentraland/dummy-token#setup).
